# Project Vision: The 90-Day Anchor Protocol

## 1. Core Philosophy
"The Anchor" is a high-fidelity, low-friction progressive web app (PWA) designed to guide User Cameron through a 90-Day Dopamine Detox and Stabilization Protocol.
It acts as an external Prefrontal Cortex—enforcing rules, tracking momentum, and providing "emergency breaks" during cravings. It is not just a tracker; it is a behavioral guardrail.

## 2. Success Criteria
- **Zero Friction Logging:** Checking a box must be instant (<1s).
- **Ubiquitous Sync:** Data must match perfectly between Laptop (Chrome) and Phone (Safari/Chrome).
- **Visual Momentum:** The user must *feel* the cost of breaking a streak and the pride of maintaining one.
- **Protocol Adherence:** The app specifically enforces "Cameron's v2.0 Protocol" rules (Anchors, Mulligans, Digital Sundown).

## 3. Key Features (MVP)
### A. The Dashboard (The "HUD")
- **Day Counter:** "Day [X] of 90" progress bar.
- **The 4 Anchors Status:** Visual indicators for Therapy, Sobriety, Sleep, Movement.
- **Mulligan Bank:** Display 3 "Hearts" (Lives). If a rule is broken, a heart is lost.

### B. Daily Workflow (Dynamic Checklist)
- **Morning Anchor:** Unlocks at 4 AM. (Breakfast, 15m Walk, Movement, Phone-Free 90m).
- **Daily Mandates:** Unlock after Morning Anchor. (Public Exposure, Coursework, Human Interaction).
- **Night Anchor:** Unlocks at 8:30 PM. (Digital Sundown, Phone Away).
- **Logic:** The "Night Anchor" cannot be checked off until 8:30 PM.

### C. The "Emergency" Protocol (Panic Button)
- A prominent red button: "I'M SLIPPING".
- **Action:** Clicking it immediately hides the UI and displays the "3-Step Circuit Breaker":
  1. STOP (Interrupt pattern).
  2. MOVE (15m walk / pushups).
  3. CONNECT (Call Mom/Therapist).
- Includes a 5-minute cooldown timer before the app unlocks again.

### D. Weekly Review (Sunday Night)
- A simple text form to log: "What broke?", "What worked?", "Next week's adjustment."

## 4. User Stories
- "As Cameron, I want to open the app on my phone at the gym and instantly check off 'Physical Movement'."
- "As Cameron, I want to see my 'Mulligans' remaining so I know how close I am to strict consequences."
- "As Cameron, I want the app to 'lock' or warn me if I try to use it during Digital Sundown (9 PM)."
